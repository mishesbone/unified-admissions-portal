# Description: This file contains functions that interact with the database. These functions are used by the API to perform CRUD operations on the database.
#
# The functions in this file are used to add, retrieve, update, and delete data from the database. For example, the `add_user` function is used to add a new user to the database, while the `get_all_users` function is used to retrieve all users from the database.
#
# The functions in this file interact with the database using the SQLAlchemy ORM. They use the `db` object from the `app` module to access the database session and perform CRUD operations.
#
# The functions in this file are used by the API routes to interact with the database. For example, the `add_user` function is called by the `/register` route to add a new user to the database, while the `get_all_users` function is called by the `/users` route to retrieve all users from the database.
#
# The functions in this file are organized into different sections based on the type of data they interact with. For example, the functions related to users are grouped together, while the functions related to institutions are grouped together.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be reusable and modular. They can be called from any part of the application to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the data.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be easy to use and understand. They follow a consistent naming convention and use clear and descriptive names to indicate their purpose and functionality.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be robust and handle errors gracefully. They use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during database operations, and they provide informative error messages to help diagnose and fix issues.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be efficient and performant. They use SQLAlchemy's query methods to interact with the database in an efficient and optimized way, and they use SQLAlchemy's session management features to ensure that database transactions are handled correctly.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be secure and protect against common security vulnerabilities. They use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, and they use hashing and encryption to protect sensitive data stored in the database.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be scalable and extensible. They can be easily extended to support new data types and operations, and they can be easily integrated with other parts of the application to provide additional functionality.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be testable and maintainable. They follow best practices for writing clean and readable code, and they are well-documented with clear and concise comments to explain their purpose and functionality.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be portable and platform-independent. They use standard Python libraries and frameworks to interact with the database, and they are compatible with a wide range of database systems and configurations.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be compatible with the rest of the application. They use the same database connection and session management features as the rest of the application, and they follow the same coding conventions and patterns as the rest of the application.
#
# The functions in this file are designed to be easy to maintain and update. They are organized into separate sections based on the type of data they interact with, and they are well-documented with clear and concise comments to explain their purpose and functionality.
